American higher education is the best in the world - but that would quickly change if guns were allowed on campuses. The idea that more guns are the solution to gun violence simply defies reason - and if you believe that, Ms. Collins, you apparently learned nothing in college. There are non-lethal alternatives for self-defense: mace, pepper spray, etc. If you could have drawn a pistol quickly enough to defend yourself (questionable, if you were taken by surprise), you certainly could have fired a can of pepper spray just as quickly. A society in which each person is responsible for his or her safety is not a civilized one - indeed that is the very definition of barbarism. No, police cannot prevent every crime, but placing our safety in their hands is vastly superior to the alternative.\n",

Cassandras cried and cried that it would fail ... until it began operating and public enthusiasm was undeniable. BART had its opponents but is now an essential public service. Then there is Los Angeles: we tore up the Red Car service in belief that freeways were the ultimate solution. They weren't.. Then folks fought against new rail systems for 20-30 years before we were finally able to embark on new systems that now enjoy high ridership levels and public approval. Light rail, commuter rail, heavy rail, high-speed rail: it doesn't seem to make a difference to a segment of our society that lays every possible obstacle in the way of passenger rail, obstacles that magically disappear when one considers highways. Makes one wonder.\n",

      "WHY CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT RAIL? That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations. Nobody wants to wait in a station in a larger city or use it's bathrooms.\n",

Ms Fernandez comments about crowd noise betray what I think must be her lack of experience actually playing tennis. I dare anyone to endure playing amid the noise and distraction of a boisterous crowd and say that it didn't affect the quality of their game. The concentration and intensity required to play tournament tennis just can't tolerate it. As for Mr. Dizikes' comments, I couldn't agree more. The game is immensely improved by the absence of the antics of the likes of Nastase, Connors, and McEnroe. All credit to the gentlemen of the game. Fashion?

Justice Ginsberg has made some extraordinary statements in the past week regarding Donald Trump, a man who has continuously shown outright contempt for our rule of law. It is my belief that Trumps rhetoric is genuine. This is not the typical say-anything to get elected scenario. He will be worse if elected. Many, if not most Republicans are equally concerned.

The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age.

My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population.

In states where teacher tenure is abolished, it is replaced with the policy that a principal or superintendent may dismiss a teacher at the end of a school year without having to give a reason or any justification whatsoever. This system creates yes-men and women -- zombies who do exactly as told and live in fear of giving an honest, professional opinion on what may be considered by some to be the curriculum or program that administrators tout as being the ultimate answer to education reform. Who would take that risk?\n",

      "After 35 years as a college professor, I see the introduction of firearms on to college campuses as a potential disaster. This is an environment in which young people, often for the first time in theri lives, are trying to navigate their way through the world at large. Examinations, personal relationships, and other factors create stresses, in some cases more than they can cope with. I would not like to face a student who feels aggrieved about a bad grade in the likelihood that they might have a firearm under their jacket. Nor should in classroom discussions, often heated at times, be conducted under such an environment. No, college is a place where children come to become adults, and minimizing threats of violence is one of the controls that we need to make to make this passage safer.\n",

      "Few here seem to realize the one belief all Federal Judges share: The rule of law is first and foremost a tool to serve business. It's part of the reason the Justices often get on so well personally. The letter of the law did not radically change concerning same sex marriage, but the attitudes of the great majority of the citizenry did and doing business became more difficult for companies doing business in states that stubbornly held on to the last century's prejudices. So the Supreme Court had a eureka moment and ruled gay people had the same rights as the rest of the American People. Donald Trump has famously promised, if elected, to use the power of the Oval Office to drag his enemies through the courts. How is that arbitrary application of power to be seen as anything but a descent into corruption and an end to rule of law and the beginning of the rule of tyrants? Do we really want to have to pay off every government official to sell shoes, bake donuts or build cars? Justice Ginsburg does not want that kind of nation, and for one, I'm glad she said so.\n",

      "\"Room for Debate: Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?\" Yes!!! The answer is not debatable. The evidence for this is voluminous, ubiquitous and unambiguous. The Orlando gun rampage and the immolation of 38 people in a gay bar in New Orleans are logical outcomes of \"Christian\" belief systems which have socialized followers to disdain LGBT people. The holocaust was similarly inspired. Congressman Rick Allen recently called for the death of homosexuals: according to Roll Call, \"[he] stands by his actions.\" So is it debatable That Christians have created a harmful atmosphere for Gays? No. It's just a fact.\n",

      "'Free' does not project value. Offering free state university tuition sounds great. Does it solve society problems? Not necessarily! I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money. They did not have to earn or borrow it. There is a tendency for them to withdraw from a class. Free public education impacts the ability of non-profit private colleges to exist. What happens when these institutions crumble? Do state schools have the capacity to pick-up non-profit private school students? Can we afford 'free' across all college students? 'Free' excites us. If it sounds too good to be true . . .\n",

Having worked on the Athens 2004 project, the real problem with regards to tourists visiting the city that were not interested in the Olympics was for a short period of about 20 days. So, the idea that it creates havoc is really not true. The worse aspect about the Olympics is the cost factor for any country. Even those held in the USA were done so at a loss. Politicians love to boast that the country will make tons of money but it is never the case. In the case of Greece, it was a major excuse that along with corrupt politicians brought financial ruin to the country. So if a country is not interested in the status quo of showing off and exploiting its taxpayers, Greece could be made the cenral point of Olympic Games once and for all. Food for thought!\n",

A more proper question for the state of New York is \"should SUNY Albany be preserved?\". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses. The elimination of the humanities at one of the larger SUNY locations is a wake up call. It is time to consolidate the sprawling SUNY system so that the surviving campuses can operate competently.

Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah \"marry\" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one \"jot or tittle\" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly \"the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order\" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold \"the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order\" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.\n",

      "Some have questioned whether a gun-carrying woman with a gun pressed against her head would have prevailed had she drawn her weapon. We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do we really want to find out? At a controversial football game, would someone kill the umpire? Doug Giebel Big Sandy, Montana\n",

      "No, don't abolish tenure, just make it more effective by giving tenure only after 4 or 5 years. Teach principals how to deal with ineffective teachers -- how to document, step up observations and evaluations, how to dismiss teachers who are not effective. The problem is that most principals don't know the difference between good and bad teachers. In my 36 years working in schools I observed that the principal usually praised the teachers who most often agreed with and flattered them. Yes, teachers usually do stay in the same job, maybe not in the same location, and it's a good thing if they do. I worked in 5 different schools over my career and the most effective schools had a good mixture of experienced and new teachers. The experienced teachers helped new teachers with discipline and techniques they had learned over the years. The new teachers added new ideas and new theories of education. Combined, they all made for an excellent school culture. I just wonder how much time Mr. Petrelli has spent in classrooms some he graduated from school?\n",

      "'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA. The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.\n",

      "Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of \"I forgot to turn my camera on,\" of course, but it's a vast improvement over \"I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work.\" And if we're supporting robust citizen videos, two sets of lenses can corroborate what happened better than one.\n",

Just as freedom of speech is the right to say unpopular things others would disagree with, liberty is the ability to make choices others may not agree with. If your drug use violates someone else's rights, perhaps because you steel from them, you can already be imprisoned. We already have a mental health commitment standard if you are a danger to yourself or others. With alcohol, there are some who use to for health benefits (a glass of wine with dinner) or recreationally (a couple bears at a party or while watching a game). There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop.

In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong.

      "I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. We need judges who clearly understand that a requirement to present one's driver's license at the polls violates the 24th amendment, as the driver's license fee is a tax. We need to rise up against efforts to disenfranchise college students through various technicalities in residency requirements as violations of the equal protection clause. Here in North Carolina, the NAACP, led by Rev. William Barber, rose up against the draconian voter suppression laws in the Moral Monday movement that swept our state. This movement needs to continue to grow, to rival the NRA is political power as the voice to protect our 15th/19th/24th/26th amendment rights.\n",

      "WHY CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT RAIL? That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations. Nobody wants to wait in a station in a larger city or use it's bathrooms.\n",

      "#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business. So maybe - just maybe - it would be a good idea for our universities to keep teaching it.\n",

      "Having lived in Germany (Army bases) and traveled widely, I am well aware of that there are few Americans that can speak foreign languages. Most Americans cannot understand why someone would want to learn a foreign language. Having said that, my 5-6 years of French and limited German never proved of much use in those countries (many Germans speak English, and the French are less than helpful to foreigners trying to speak their language) or elsewhere. Later in life I took up Spanish, and this has proved to be very useful in travel and being able to practice it on a regular basis (Washington, DC area). I think that the colleges need to rethink their language curriculum. At an east coast boarding school I attended in the '60s, Latin classes were mandatory absent a waiver. The world has changed and French use in the world has changed dramatically. Colleges need to take this into account. It is a shame to have people spend years on these languages and then never using them in their adult life. BTW I have one niece taking college Arabic and another taking high school Spanish.\n",

But the high-income well-educated suburban-raised millenials flocking to SF and NYC and other cities, with jobs in tech, finance, media (and often financial help from parents) are doing pretty well. They feel pretty entitled to enjoy their delayed adulthood with their disposable income in bars, food delivery and chain stores. This demographic tsunami has displaced low and middle income residents of formerly intact neighborhoods in SF and NYC.

      "For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems\n",

According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages.

Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform.

It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.\n",

The government realized it would not be able to property maintain this arsenal and agreed, by treaty, to relinquish it on the basis that the USA and UK agreed to defend its territorial integrity. Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one. Such passive encouragement of nuclear arms proliferation is contrary to the stated policy of the Western world to promote the reduction of such weapons.

But in today's world, where every entity we deal with in commerce has every speck of data on us, there's really nothing to fight about anymore. In fact, it would be much easier if we all had a government ID. The ID could take the form of a state driver's license or state ID. It must be free to obtain and universally available. It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time. If this were the case, we'd no longer have these debates about IDs and employment, voting, housing, serving on a jury, commerce and travel. The only reason to oppose a national ID is because you want to ensure that people here illegally can still participate in all functions that a citizen can, and that's not a good reason.\n",

This tells me everything I need to know about both this man and the state of our government run secondary education. In that, it is not so much education as it is indoctrination of young adults.

Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish.

If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry.
