590,"This nation is going to have to admit that its tradition of luring more than a million poor unskilled immigrants to this country a year, with the express purpose of exploiting them with below living wage wages (and then taxing our dwindling middle class to get social service subsidies needed to keep them alive), is complex comoflaged form of slavery that is no more moral than the formal black slavery that so oppressed and humiliated our nation. It must stop now. If we have to pay a bit more for food so be it. No one accepts former complaints that ending black slavery would raise the cost of cotton cloth, so why do we dare mention the cost of ending agricultural worker slavery.
