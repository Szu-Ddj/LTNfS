This lack of fairness and justice is alarming and calls for greater efforts towards gender equality. #whatisjustice #inequality,"The feminist movement includes a proportion of feminists who are strongly opposed to prostitution, seeing it as a form of violence against women. These feminists argue that in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity. Catharine MacKinnon argues that women in prostitution have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with and the money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. Therefore, they argue that true consent in prostitution is not possible, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.
The women in the anti-pornography camp argued against prostitution, claiming it is forced on women who have no alternatives."" and ""The Prostitutes rights movement of the early 1970s evolved directly from the women's movement, but adds: ""The women's movement in the U.S. has always been ambivalent about prostitutes"".
Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations."" / ""Feminist Movement"

Liberal feminists tend to be split between the argument of whether all sex work is degrading to women, and the argument that sex work is work, and should be treated as such. Either way, liberal feminists believe in the legalization of sex work, as criminalization prohibits women's ability to control their own bodies.
The feminist movement drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people, and some tensions arose during the late 1960s and 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white, straight, and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, which also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.
Many women organized to form the National Organization for Women in 1966, whose 'Statement of Purpose' declared that the right women had to equality was one small part of the nationwide civil rights revolution that was happening during the 1960s.
Many feminists consider strip clubs to be insulting to women's human rights and dignity."

The feminist movements represented by writers Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem consider men oppressed by gender roles. Friedan argued that feminism would benefit both genders and was part of the human rights movement. Steinem suggested that liberation was for both genders, as men's burdens would be shared. Ellen Willis, weighing economics and feminism, considered an alliance with men necessary to women's liberation.

[...] With the turn of the 19th century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights too. [...] Women's suffrage (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's Australasian colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893; [...] In Britain, the suffragettes and suffragists campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the Representation of the People Act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property. In the US, notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery before championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God. In the US, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states.
In 1963, Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States.
The first wave of the feminist movement comprised women's suffrage movements of the 19th and early-20th centuries, promoting women's right to vote."
