The given [Sentence] is related to the [Target] of the [Wikipedia Document], which is ""Legalization of Abortion"". The [Wikipedia Document] discusses the two main sides of the abortion debate. It mentions that those who oppose abortion primarily do so on the basis that a fetus is an innocent human person, or because a fetus is a potential life that will develop into a fully functional human being. These individuals believe that a fetus is a person upon conception. On the other hand, those who support abortion draw a distinction between human being and human person, arguing that while the fetus is innocent and biologically human, it is not a person with a right to life. They have proposed criteria, such as consciousness, that a being must possess to qualify as a person with a right to life. Mary Ann Warren suggests consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self-motivation, the ability to communicate, and self-awareness. She concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain), the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible."

Argentina has long been a strongly Catholic country, and protesters seeking liberalized abortion in 2013 directed anger toward the Catholic Church.

The Argentine Senate approved the bill 38—29 on December 29, and it is expected to be signed by President Alberto Fernandez.

Privacy can be understood as a condition in which one is not observed or disturbed by government.

The 14th Amendment has given rise to the doctrine of Substantive due process, which is said to guarantee various privacy rights, including the right to bodily integrity. In Roe v Wade, the Court decided that the state has an ""important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life"" from the point of viability on, but that prior to viability, the woman's fundamental rights are more compelling than that of the state.
Discussion of the putative personhood of the fetus may be complicated by the current legal status of children.

Anti-abortion supporters argue that abortion is morally wrong on the basis that a fetus is an innocent human person or because a fetus is a potential life that will, in most cases, develop into a fully functional human being. They believe that a fetus is a person upon conception. Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain), the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible. Philosophers such as Aquinas use the concept of individuation. They argue that abortion is not permissible from the point at which individual human identity is realized. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of monozygotic twinning can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.""
The Catholic Church remains highly influential in Latin America, and opposes the legalisation of abortion. The American Convention on Human Rights, which in 2013 had 23 Latin American parties, declares human life as commencing with conception. In Latin America, abortion on request is only legal in Cuba (1965), Uruguay (2012), Argentina (2021), Colombia (2022) and in parts of Mexico.

Time has stated that the issue of bodily privacy is ""the core"" of the abortion debate. In political terms, privacy can be understood as a condition in which one is not observed or disturbed by government. Traditionally, American courts have located the right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the penumbra of the Bill of Rights. The landmark decision Roe v Wade relied on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that federal rights shall be applied equally to all persons born in the United States. The 14th Amendment has given rise to the doctrine of Substantive due process, which is said to guarantee various privacy rights, including the right to bodily integrity.

From this perspective the right to abortion can be construed to be necessary in order for women to achieve equality with men whose freedom is not nearly so restricted by having children.
Some anti-abortion supporters argue that if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus has a right to life, then having an abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another. According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless and morally wrong to treat that thing as if it lacks a right to life (for example by killing it). This would place abortion in the same moral category as manslaughter (if it turns out that the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of criminal negligence (if it turns out that the fetus does not have a right to life).
Legalization of abortion is a key point in abortion rights in the United States was the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which struck down most state laws restricting abortion, thereby decriminalizing and legalizing elective abortion in a number of states."
