- In December 2012, near the end of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, a nonprofit group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed a FOIA request seeking records about her email.
- Emails sent to Clinton's private clintonemail.com address were first discovered in March 2013, when a hacker named ""Guccifer"" widely distributed emails sent to Clinton from Sidney Blumenthal, which Guccifer obtained by illegally accessing Blumenthal's email account.
- The emails dealt with the 2012 Benghazi attack and other issues in Libya and revealed the existence of her clintonemail.com address.

""In 2014, months prior to public knowledge of the server's existence, Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills and two attorneys worked to identify work-related emails on the server to be archived and preserved for the State Department.
In August 2015, the New York Times reported on ""interviews with more than 75 Democratic governors, lawmakers, candidates and party members"" on the email issue."" / ""Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, defended Clinton, saying: ""Let me say this. Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right.
Hillary Clinton is the target of the given sentence. The Wikipedia document talks about the controversy surrounding the use of Clinton's personal email server while she served as Secretary of State. The document mentions that the State Department found work-related emails she did not provide, and that several of the emails contained classified information that was not marked as classified. The document also mentions that investigators found four emails containing classified information in a sample of 40 emails and that the information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system. Therefore, the sentences from the Wikipedia document related to the given sentence and target are: ""A June 29, 2015, memorandum from the Inspector General of the State Department, Steve A. Linick, said that a review of the 55,000-page email release found 'hundreds of potentially classified emails.' A July 17, 2015, follow-up memo… stated that they had confirmed that several of the emails contained classified information that was not marked as classified, at least one of which was publicly released... Investigators from their office, searching a randomly chosen sample of 40 emails, found four that contained classified information that originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Their statement said that the information they found was classified when sent, remained so as of their inspection, and 'never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.'""
Hillary Clinton used a private email server to conduct government business during her tenure as Secretary of State, which allowed her to have tight control over her emails and avoid disclosure by Congressional subpoena. The State Department acknowledged that government officials have used private email accounts for official business before Clinton, but Kerry is the first Secretary of State to primarily use a state.gov email account. The Federal Records Act allows the use of personal email for government business as long as relevant official communications, including all work-related emails, are preserved by the agency. However, experts discourage this practice and believe that official email accounts should be used instead."

In March 2013, she formally stated her support for same-sex marriage after stepping down as Secretary of State, stating she supported it ""personally and as a matter of policy and law."" Clinton condemned Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In December 2015, Clinton published a plan for LGBT rights.
Clinton's views on same-sex marriage evolved considerably over the years. On December 9, 1999, Clinton told a group of gay contributors that LGBT people should be allowed to openly serve in the United States military. Also, that same day, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson stated she supported the Defense of Marriage Act and that ""same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets."" On June 26, 2013, Hillary and Bill Clinton issued a joint statement in favor of ruling in the case of the United States v. Windsor. During her 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton stressed the importance of anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity. On October 4, 2015, Clinton came out in favor of allowing transgender people to openly serve in the United States military. On December 17, 2015, Clinton revealed a comprehensive plan for LGBT rights, including an endorsement of federal ban LGBT conversion therapy for minors. On October 11, 2016, her Twitter account stated conversion therapy for minors should be ended."

Hillary Clinton's health care reform plan was proposed in her 2008 presidential campaign, the so-called ""American Health Choices Plan"".

She proposes to defend the Affordable Care Act from efforts to repeal it; she will build upon it. Clinton claimed during a debate in January 2016 that ""We now have driven (health care) costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years"".

Emails sent to Clinton's private clintonemail.com address were first discovered in March 2013, when a hacker named ""Guccifer"" widely distributed emails sent to Clinton from Sidney Blumenthal, which Guccifer obtained by illegally accessing Blumenthal's email account. The emails dealt with the 2012 Benghazi attack and other issues in Libya and revealed the existence of her clintonemail.com address. In the summer of 2014, lawyers from the State Department noticed a number of emails from Clinton's personal account, while reviewing documents requested by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. A request by the State Department for additional emails led to negotiations with her lawyers and advisors.
Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, asserted that some time after October 2014, Clinton 'unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean' and 'summarily decided to delete all emails.'
In just six days, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta).

One question frequently raised is why Hillary Clinton chose to delete her emails, as seen in the hashtag #clintonemail.","Since the given [Wikipedia Document] talks about the controversy regarding Hillary Clinton's emails, it is related to the given [Sentence] and [Target]. Therefore, the summarized output is:
- Clinton's team worked to identify work-related emails on the server to archive them.
- Clinton decided to delete 31,830 older personal emails from the server.
- The PRN technician failed to carry out the instruction to delete personal emails from the server.
- Some of the deleted emails were recovered by the FBI.
- Clinton critics accused her or her aides of deleting emails that were under subpoena.
Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said, in a statement regarding the June 30, 2015 email releases, ""These emails ... are just the tip of the iceberg, and we will never get full disclosure until Hillary Clinton releases her secret server for an independent investigation."" Trey Gowdy said on June 29, 2015, that he would press the State Department for a fuller accounting of Clinton's emails, after the Benghazi panel retrieved 15 additional emails to Sidney Blumenthal that the department had not provided to the committee.
On March 27, 2015, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, asserted that some time after October 2014, Clinton ""unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean"" and ""summarily decided to delete all emails.""
Clinton turned over copies of 30,000 State Department business-related emails from her private server that belonged in the public domain; she later explained that she instructed her lawyer to err on the side of disclosure, turning over any emails that might be work-related. Her aides subsequently deleted about 31,000 emails from the server dated during the same time period that Clinton regarded as personal and private. State Department employees do have the right to delete personal emails.
Several emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton while serving as United States Secretary of State contained classified information that was marked at the sensitive but unclassified levels at the time. Clinton and her aides said the server was never hacked. Clinton's conduct was the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding the server in which she used exclusively during her tenure as Secretary of State. While FBI Director James Comey recommended that no charges be filed against her in July 2016, he criticized her handling of classified information, describing Clinton's actions as ""extremely careless.""
At the same time, many Democratic leaders showed increasing frustration among party leaders of Clinton's handling of the email issue."

As early as 2009, officials with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) expressed concerns over possible violations of normal federal government record-keeping procedures at the State Department under then-Secretary Clinton. In the summer of 2014, lawyers from the State Department noticed a number of emails from Clinton's personal account, while reviewing documents requested by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. A March 2, 2015 New York Times article broke the story that the Benghazi panel had discovered that Clinton exclusively used her own private email server rather than a government-issued one throughout her time as Secretary of State, and that her aides took no action to preserve emails sent or received from her personal accounts as required by law.
sentences from [Wikipedia Document] related to the given [Sentence] and the given [Target]: 
- ""Kind of scares me that there are still thousands of emails that have not been released from Hillary's private emails."" - This sentence is related to the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's usage of a private email server for official government business while she was Secretary of State.
On March 27, 2015, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, asserted that some time after October 2014, Clinton ""unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean"" and ""summarily decided to delete all emails."" Clinton's attorney, David E. Kendall, said that day that an examination showed that no copies of any of Clinton's emails remained on the server.
Some historical context, Secretary Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a state.gov email account."" According to Harf, use by government officials of personal email for government business is permissible under the Federal Records Act, so long as relevant official communications, including all work-related emails, are preserved by the agency. Jason R. Baron, the former head of litigation at NARA, described the practice as ""highly unusual"" but not a violation of the law. Baron told the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2015 that ""any employee's decision to conduct all email correspondence through a private email network, using a non-.gov address, is inconsistent with long-established policies and practices under the Federal Records Act and NARA regulations governing all federal agencies.
The Wikipedia Document contains sentences related to the given [Sentence] and the given [Target].
The email issue did arise shortly before lunch, in a ""a shouting match"" between Republican committee chair Trey Gowdy and two Democrats, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings. Late in the hearing, Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, accused Clinton of changing her accounts of the email service, leading to a ""heated exchange"" in which Clinton ""repeated that she had made a mistake in using a private email account""
At the time of Senate confirmation hearings on Hillary Clinton's nomination as Secretary of State, the domain names clintonemail.com, wjcoffice.com, and presidentclinton.com were registered to Eric Hoteham, with the home of Clinton and her husband in Chappaqua, New York, as the contact address. The domains were pointed to a private email server that Clinton (who never had a state.gov email account) used to send and receive email."

Trey Gowdy said on June 29, 2015, that he would press the State Department for a fuller accounting of Clinton's emails, after the Benghazi panel retrieved 15 additional emails to Sidney Blumenthal that the department had not provided to the committee.
On August 20, 2015, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan stated that Hillary Clinton's actions of maintaining a private email server were in direct conflict with U.S. government policy.
Hillary Clinton is mentioned multiple times throughout the Wikipedia document in relation to her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State. The document mentions her personal emails, her deletion of emails, and her lawyers delivering boxes of printed paper containing emails. Therefore, the relevant sentences are: ""Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails. Clinton withheld almost 32,000 emails deemed to be of a personal nature...A March 2, 2015 New York Times article broke the story that the Benghazi panel had discovered that Clinton exclusively used her own private email server rather than a government-issued one throughout her time as Secretary of State, and that her aides took no action to preserve emails sent or received from her personal accounts as required by law.""
On March 27, 2015, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, asserted that some time after October 2014, Clinton ""unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean. On June 22, 2015, the Benghazi panel released emails between Clinton and Sidney Blumenthal, who had been recently deposed by the committee. Committee chairman Gowdy issued a press release criticizing Clinton for not providing the emails to the State Department. Clinton had said she provided all work-related emails to the State Department, and that only emails of personal nature on her private server were destroyed. In response, Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill, when asked about the discrepancy said: ""She has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."" On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified before the committee and answered members' questions for eleven hours before the Committee in a public hearing."

After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage...Public reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior.
Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual.
Clinton admitted to having extramarital affairs with singer Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky."

- Clinton turned over copies of 30,000 State Department business-related emails from her private server that belonged in the public domain; 
- her aides subsequently deleted about 31,000 emails from the server dated during the same time period that Clinton regarded as personal and private. 
- Clinton has used humor to try to shrug off the scandals.
""no records responsive to your request were located."" Emails sent to Clinton's private clintonemail.com address were first discovered in March 2013, when a hacker named ""Guccifer"" widely distributed emails sent to Clinton from Sidney Blumenthal, which Guccifer obtained by illegally accessing Blumenthal's email account. The emails dealt with the 2012 Benghazi attack and other issues in Libya and revealed the existence of her clintonemail.com address. In October, the State Department sent letters to Clinton and all previous Secretaries of State back to Madeleine Albright requesting emails and documents related to their work while in office. On December 5, 2014, Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails. Clinton withheld almost 32,000 emails deemed to be of a personal nature. A March 2, 2015 New York Times article broke the story that the Benghazi panel had discovered that Clinton exclusively used her own private email server rather than a government-issued one throughout her time as Secretary of State, and that her aides took no action to preserve emails sent or received from her personal accounts as required by law.
Clinton's attorney, David E. Kendall, said that day that an examination showed that no copies of any of Clinton's emails remained on the server. Kendall said the server was reconfigured to only retain emails for 60 days after Clinton lawyers had decided which emails needed to be turned over. Clinton had said she provided all work-related emails to the State Department, and that only emails of a personal nature on her private server were destroyed. The State Department confirmed that 10 emails and parts of five others from Sidney Blumenthal regarding Benghazi, which the committee had made public on June 22, could not be located in the Department's records, but that the 46 other, previously unreleased Libya-related Blumenthal emails published by the committee, were in the Department's records. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified before the committee and answered members' questions for eleven hours before the Committee in a public hearing. Late in the hearing, Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio accused Clinton of changing her accounts of the email service, leading to a 'heated exchange' in which Clinton said that she had erred in making a private email account, but denied having dealt with anything marked classified, instead seeking 'to be transparent by publicly releasing her emails.'"

In 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"". She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage.
