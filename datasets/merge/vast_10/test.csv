33,"Christians appropriated the ""Old Testament"" aka the Jewish Scriptures as a prefiguration of the Greek ""New Testament."" So anything in the OT that they found handy, like God raining down destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, they tout incessantly. If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant ""except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on."" The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father. For Dreher to say, as another commenter pointed out, that Christians have a right to base national policy and law on their own religious beliefs, is to assert the primacy of their personal beliefs over the beliefs and rights of others. That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against ""Sharia law"" would gladly impose ""Christian law"" on the nation.

78,"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours.

104,"The Chief Justice's analogy to a baseball umpire was terrible then and it's still terrible now. Yes, judges normally call judicial balls and strikes. They accept the playing field as level and then apply the rules to whatever controversy arises between the players.

202,"Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities. The error here, as Professor Nussbaum says, is in assuming that the two areas of study are unrelated and separable, which they are not. The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society.

If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity.

Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War. Justice Taney, for example, never publicly took Lincoln to task, though Lincoln often eviscerated his Dred Scott decision. Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray.

488,"Maybe its time to let Greece permanently host the Olympics as they wanted to do anyway. Having worked on the Athens 2004 project, the real problem with regards to tourists visiting the city that were not interested in the Olympics was for a short period of about 20 days. So, the idea that it creates havoc is really not true. The worse aspect about the Olympics is the cost factor for any country. Even those held in the USA were done so at a loss. Politicians love to boast that the country will make tons of money but it is never the case.

566,"Anne, I believe this discussion is wrongly focused. A university that does not offer study in major languages,classics, or theater is in a sorry state. The value of offering study in the humanities should not need defending. The question, ""should the humanities be preserved?"", is absurd and offensive. A more proper question for the state of New York is ""should SUNY Albany be preserved?"". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses.

573,As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

583,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",justice term limit,1,∀x (is a term limit for justices(x) → solves the problem(x)) → support,∀x (is a term limit(x) → (aligns with politics(x) ∧ prevents long tenure(x))) → support,∀x (is a justice(x) → has a term limit(x)) → is a solution(x) → support,∀x (is a term limit for justices(x) → solves the problem(x)) → support

Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable.

I worked in 5 different schools over my career and the most effective schools had a good mixture of experienced and new teachers. The experienced teachers helped new teachers with discipline and techniques they had learned over the years. The new teachers added new ideas and new theories of education. Combined, they all made for an excellent school culture. I just wonder how much time Mr. Petrelli has spent in classrooms some he graduated from school?",stability,1,∀x ((represents stability(x) ∧ represents tenure(x))) → support,∃x (mentions stability(x) ∧ epresses a benefit of stability(x)) → neutral,∀x (is a teacher(x) → ∃y (is a principal(y) ∧ is effective(y) ∧ is stable(x))) → support,∃x (mentions stability(x) ∧ expresses a benefit of stability(x)) → neutral

Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire.

These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes.

That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against ""Sharia law"" would gladly impose ""Christian law"" on the nation.

What happens, for example, when one of the players can't even get inside the stadium because he's black? Or when the players bet on the game? What happens when the game's basic integrity is at issue? That's when Supreme Court justices earn their paycheck, and that's when saying ""my job's to call balls and strikes"" is a meaningless cop out.

Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright.

1108,"This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

1137,For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided.

It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico.

1261,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Religious liberty does not mean having the right to impose one's own religious beliefs on others, which is what denying LGBT people civil rights amounts to. For example, allowing same-sex marriage by those who want it presents no danger to those who oppose it and in no way infringes on your right not to engage in same-sex marriage, either individually or as a group. Being LGBT is not a disease, either physical or emotional and it is not contagious; it is a matter of one's biological make-up.

Which is more likely: that I'm an outlier, or that a program that encourages people to bike by making streets safer for bikers and supplying new bikers with free maps of safe routes around the city is actually working as Bloomberg claims it is?",ginsburg,2,∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is Ginsburg(x)) → neutral,∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is ginsburg(x)) → neutral,"∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is related to the target ""ginsburg""(x)) → neutral",∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is target(x)) → neutral

By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere.
