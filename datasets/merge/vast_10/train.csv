Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal.

Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense.

She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons.

The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding?

Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others.

736,"I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that ""Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved."" As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father.

737,"It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation.

I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage.

Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year.

However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing.",city,2,∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is a city(x)) → neutral,∀x (¬is mentioned(x) ∧ ¬is referenced(x)) → ¬is a city(x) → Neutral,∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is a city(x)) → neutral,∀x (¬(is mentioned(x) ∨ is referenced(x)) → ¬is a city(x)) → neutral

In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good.
